/*  Time complexity for Approach-1 : O(N!)
    Unlike the brute force approach, we will only place queens on squares that
aren't under attack. For the first queen, we have N options. For the next queen,
we won't attempt to place it in the same column as the first queen, and there
must be at least one square attacked diagonally by the first queen as well.
Thus, the maximum number of squares we can consider for the second queen is
    (Nâˆ’2). For the third queen, we won't attempt to place it in 2 columns
already occupied by the first 2 queens, and there must be at least two squares
attacked diagonally from the first 2 queens. Thus, the maximum number of squares
we can consider for the third queen is (N-4). This pattern continues, resulting
in an approximate time complexity of O(N!)
//Approach-1 (Simple dfs)
//T.C : O(N!) - Read the reason above
//S.C : O(N) to store the result
